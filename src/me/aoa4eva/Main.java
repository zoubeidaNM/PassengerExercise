	This exercise has the following classes:

	- Passenger (each passenger on board). Each passenger has a stop.

	- Bus (the bus that passengers board). A bus has several stops and several passengers.

	- BusStop - the stops available. Stops may be assigned to buses, and passengers also have stops.

	Look at each class to see what it does and how it works.

	* 1. Assign a random bus stop to a passenger
	* 2. Make the bus ply its route with the drive method
	* 3. Let passengers tell the bus driver when they are stopping
	* 4. Let passengers get off the bus
